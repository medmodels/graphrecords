# AI Policy

We are not against AI. It is a powerful tool that can genuinely help with software development. However, AI-generated contributions need transparency and human oversight to maintain quality. Without that, AI tends to produce large volumes of plausible-looking but low-quality work that wastes reviewers' time.

This policy applies to all contributions to GraphRecords.

## Rules

- All AI usage in code contributions must be disclosed. State which tool(s) you used (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) and describe what parts of the contribution were AI-assisted.

- AI-generated code must be fully verified and tested by a human before submission. Do not submit code you haven't personally tested and reviewed.

- Comments and descriptions (e.g. in issues, discussions, or pull requests) can use AI assistance without disclosure, for example using AI as a translation help. The content must still be reviewed and edited by a human. Fully autonomous AI agents writing contributions on your behalf are not acceptable.

- AI-generated media (images, videos, audio, art) is not allowed.

- Maintainers may handle policy violations at their discretion, including closing pull requests.
